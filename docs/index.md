## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like RAM users, groups, and policies?

Dashboards are available for ECS, KMS, RAM, OSS, and VPC services.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Alicloud plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/alicloud) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install alicloud
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default Alicloud credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/alicloud#multi-account-connections) or [customize Alicloud credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/alicloud#configuring-alicloud-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mod-alicloud-insights
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.
